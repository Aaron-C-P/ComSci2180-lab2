                            of mental age to chronological age times 100” to measure IQ. Over time, having a high IQ came to be considered a mark of brilliance—the most cited examples being Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, both with an IQ score of

                            Emotional Intelligence. EQ is the ability to understand your own and others’ emotions, and to use emotional information to guide thinking, behavior, and interpersonal relationships.</p>
