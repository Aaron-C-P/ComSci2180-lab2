                            <h5> Intelligence Quotient </h5> IQ signifies mental potential and academic ability. It is a measure of your reasoning ability: how you can use information to answer questions and come up with valid predictions. The scale tests
                            five factors: knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, working memory and fluid reasoning. If you have a high IQ, it means that you have functional ADL (activities of daily living) skills and can function
                            in a society well. It also means that you have a good set of executive functions. I would say that IQ is important, at least, for independent living skills: taking care of self, household affairs, job and community participation
                            and contribution.

                                <h5> Emotional Quotient </h5> EQ, on the other hand, is important in terms of determining your success in life areas such as work and career. It surfaced in the 1990s and popularized in 1995 by Daniel Goleman, with his book,
                                Emotional Intelligence. EQ is your ability to understand emotions: your own and others’ well. More than your brain, you use your heart to guide your thoughts, your behavior and your relationships. If IQ measures what the
                                brain can do, EQ focuses more on what the heart signifies, including self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills. How do we measure EQ? 6seconds.org champions the cause of emotional intelligence.
                                They have standardized tools to measure your EQ such as Vital Signs and Six Seconds EI. They also train trainors and teachers to expand best EQ practices among children and adults alike. Just a side note, I went to La Vie
                                Institute last summer and inquired about their EQ classes for the son. Their program’s goals and activities from Six Seconds sounded fun and insightful but we were not able to push through because of the pandemic.EQ is
                                the ability to understand your own and others’ emotions, and to use emotional information to guide thinking, behavior, and interpersonal relationships.</p>
